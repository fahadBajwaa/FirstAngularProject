🟢 1. CSS vs SCSS: Understand the key differences between CSS and SCSS, and why SCSS is preferred in Angular projects for features like nesting, variables, and mixins.

- Superset of CSS.

- SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a CSS pre-processor syntax that extends vanilla CSS by adding programming-style feature,
then compiles down to standard CSS before being served to browsers.

- It’s fully compatible with existing CSS: any valid CSS file is also valid SCSS, plus we get extra powerful capabilities.

​🟥 Key differences between SCSS and CSS:

- 🟨 Nesting: 
SCSS allows to nest selector inside one another, mirroring HTML structure and avoiding repetition., whereas
CSS requires each selector to be declared separately.

- 🟨 Variables:
SCSS supports variables (e.g. $primary-color: #3498db;) that let us store reusable values for colors, font sizes, breakpoints, etc., 
while CSS variables (custom properties) are newer and limited to modern browsers

- 🟨 Mixins:
Mixins in SCSS let us define reusable blocks of styles (e.g. @mixin center { display: flex; justify-content: center; })
and include them anywhere with @include, a feature absent in plain CSS.

- 🟨 Partials & Imports:
SCSS enables to break stylesheets into modular “partials” (files prefixed with _) and import them into a main file, 
improving organization—CSS lacks a native import mechanism that supports modularization.


- 🟨 Functions & Operations:
Beyond simple math operations (e.g. width: $base * 2;), 
SCSS offers built‑in functions for color manipulation, string operations, and more, enabling dynamic style generation.


​🟥 Why SCSS Is Preferred in Angular Projects? --> " ng new my-angular-app --style=scss "

- 🟨 Built‑In Angular CLI Support:
The Angular CLI lets us create a new project with SCSS out of the box using ng new MyApp --style=scss, making setup effortless.

- 🟨 Component‑Level Styling:
Angular’s component architecture encourages encapsulated styles; SCSS variables and mixins make it easy to share design tokens (colors, spacing scales) across components.

- 🟨 Maintainability & Scalability
Nesting and partials help maintain a clear folder structure for large projects, reducing CSS bloat and avoiding selector collisions.

- 🟨 Theming & Reusability:
SCSS variables and mixins facilitate creating theme files (light/dark modes) that can be swapped or extended, streamlining global style changes.


​🟥 Getting Started with SCSS in Angular:

- 🟨 Create a New Angular Project with SCSS:

" ng new my-angular-app --style=scss "
This configures the CLI to generate .scss files for new components by default.


- 🟨 Global Styles & Variables: 

Define global variables and mixins in "src/styles/_variables.scss" and "src/styles/_mixins.scss".

In angular.json, ensure "styles": ["src/styles.scss"] is set and import partials there:

@import 'styles/variables';
@import 'styles/mixins';
``` :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}.

- 🟨 Using SCSS in Components:

In any component’s .scss file, use nesting, variables, and mixins directly:

@import '../styles/variables';

.card {
  @include box-shadow(0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1));
  h2 {
    color: $primary-color;
  }
}

- 🟨 Compile & Serve:
Run "ng serve" —the CLI watches SCSS files, compiles to CSS, and reloads in the browser automatically.

🟢 2. Injecting Styles in TypeScript: Explore methods to apply styles from .scss or .css files directly into components via styleUrls, and how to use inline styles when needed.

Details provided in file "app.component.ts".

🟢 3. styleUrls vs styles: Understand the difference between using styleUrls (external files) and styles (inline), and when each should be used.

​🟥 Difference b/w styleUrls & styles:

- "styleUrls" lets us link one or more external CSS or SCSS files to a component, 
so the styles live in separate files that are easy to edit, reuse, and benefit from full editor tooling.

- "styles" let us write small bits of CSS directly inside the @Component decorator as inline strings,
 which is perfect for quick or dynamic tweaks without creating extra files.

 ​🟥 What to Choose b/w styleUrls & styles?

- Choose "styleUrls" when the component has many styles or we want to share style files across multiple components—separate files keep the project organized and maintainable.

 -Choose "styles" when we only need a handful of CSS rules (e.g., under ten lines) so we can avoid having too many files and keep everything in one place.
