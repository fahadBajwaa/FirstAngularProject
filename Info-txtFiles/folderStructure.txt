//  ----------------------  🟢  Project/ Folder Structure   🟢  ---------------------- 


1. Project Name: 'my-firstangular-project"  ​🟥

This is the main folder of my project. Everything related to my Angular app is inside this folder.


2. System/Config Folders:  ( .angular/, .vscode/, .node_modules/ )  ​🟥

We don't edit these usually.

-> .angular/: Internal Angular info for the CLI, like build/cache settings. - " When we run  [ ng serve ] command.
-> .vscode/: Editor-specific settings (used by VS code).
-> .node_modules/: This folder contain all the libraries, app depends on.


3. Public/ : (from Angular 18) ​🟥

This folder is used to store all public assets like images and icons. 
The public/ folder is designated for storing static files that our application needs to serve directly to the browser without any processing by Angular. This includes:​
Images: Logos, icons, and other graphics.
Fonts: Custom font files.
Documents: PDFs or other downloadable files.
Other Static Assets: Any files that don't require Angular's compilation or bundling.

During the build process, Angular copies the contents of the public/ folder directly into the root of the output directory (dist/). 
This means the files are accessible at the root level of the deployed application.​

Angular's build configuration (angular.json) includes an assets array that specifies which files and folders should be copied as-is to the output directory. 
With Angular 18, this configuration looks like:​

"assets": [
  {
    "glob": "**/*",
    "input": "public"
  }
]
This tells Angular to include all files from the public/ folder in the build output.​


4.  src/ folder: ​🟥

 this works as the “engine room” for app’s functionality.

-> app.component.ts:	The main “brain” of the root component. Defines a TypeScript class with data & logic.
-> app.component.html:	The view/template for that component—HTML markup we see on screen.
-> app.component.css:	The local styles for the component—colors, spacing, fonts applied only here.
-> app.component.spec.ts:	A test file generated for us; it can check that our component works correctly.
-> app.config.ts:	A place to store configuration values (e.g. API endpoints, feature flags).
-> app.routes.ts:	Defines our application’s routes—which component to show for which URL path.

--- Other files in src/

-> index.html:	The shell HTML that the browser loads first. It holds <app-root> where Angular injects our app.
-> main.ts:	The bootstrap file. It tells Angular: “Load the root module and start the app.”
-> styles.css:	Global CSS—styles here apply across all components.


5.  Root-level files (beside src/) ​🟥

When we run ng new, the CLI also creates these configuration and metadata files:

-> .editorconfig:	Ensures consistent code formatting across editors (tabs vs. spaces, line breaks).
-> .gitignore: 	Lists files/folders (like node_modules) that Git should ignore when we commit.
-> angular.json:	The Angular CLI config: tells Angular how to build, serve, and test our app.
-> package.json:	Project manifest: lists our app’s dependencies (Angular, other libraries) and scripts (e.g. ng serve).
-> package-lock.json:	Locks exact versions of every dependency, ensuring consistent installs for everyone.
-> README.md:	A markdown file where we can describe our project, how to run it, etc.
-> tsconfig.json:	The base TypeScript config for the entire project.
-> tsconfig.app.json:	TypeScript settings specific to our application code (excludes test files).
-> tsconfig.spec.json:	TypeScript settings for our test environment.
