ðŸŸ¢ 1. What is Angular Component? How can we use One Component in other Component?

â€‹ðŸŸ¥ In "main.ts" file:

forExample:

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig).catch((err) => console.error(err) );
bootstrapApplication(TestSCSSStylingsComponent); 

This isn't a good and recommended approach(Calling bootstrapApplication() more than once), 

as Angular supports the idea of a ðŸŸ¨"Component Tree", with root component (AppComponent) at the top and other components nested in it. 
So using this idea, we will only call bootStrapApplication function "ONCE".

â€‹ðŸŸ¥ Why we use this approach?

Because with Component Tree approach, all those compoents will be a part of same TreeWalker, same Angular ApplicationInitStatus, therefore will be able to 
work together, exchange Data, i.e. communcate with each other. 

â€‹ðŸŸ¥ How to use this?

We will have one main root Component (AppComponent) and then use any other Component, in that component Template (configuration will be in the "ts" file).
